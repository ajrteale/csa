\subsection*{Relevant employments in respect of which no amount is to be allowed}

21.—(1) No allowance shall be made in respect of travelling costs in respect of journeys between the relevant person’s home and his work place or between his work place and his home in a particular relevant employment if the condition set out in paragraph 22 or 23 is satisfied in respect of that employment.

(2) The condition mentioned in paragraph 22, or as the case may be 23, is satisfied in relation to a case where the relevant person has more than one work place in a relevant employment only where the employer provides assistance of the kind mentioned in that paragraph in respect of all of the work places to or from which the relevant person travels in the course of that employment, but those journeys in respect of which that assistance is provided shall be disregarded in computing the total distance travelled by the relevant person in the course of the relevant employment.

\medskip

22.  The condition is that the relevant employer provides transport of any description in connection with the employment which is available to the relevant person for any part of the journey between his home and his work place or between his work place or between his work place and his home.

\medskip

23.  The condition is that the relevant employer bears any part of the travelling costs arising from the relevant person travelling between his home and his work place or between his work place and his home in connection with that employment, and for the purposes of this paragraph he does not bear any part of that cost where he does no more than—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]

($b$) make a loan to the relevant person;

($c$) pay to the relevant person an increased amount of remuneration,

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations provide for various matters relating to the calculation of child support maintenance under the Child Support Act 1991 (“the Act”) and also make provision for special cases under the Act.

Regulation 1 contains interpretation provisions. Regulation 2 contains general provisions regarding calculations under the Act.

Regulation 3 prescribes the amounts which are to be taken into account in the maintenance requirement formula in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act. Regulation 4 defines the “basic rate” of child benefit for the purposes of that paragraph.

Regulation 5 prescribes values for the general rule formula in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Act. Regulation 6 prescribes an amount and a value for the purposes of the additional element formula in paragraph 4 of that Schedule.

Regulation 7 and 8 and Schedules 1 and 2 prescribe the amounts to be taken into account as assessable income for the purposes of paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the Act. Regulations 9 and 10 prsecribe the exempt income of the absent parent and the parent with care for the purposes of that paragraph.

Regulation 11 prescribes the protected income level of that absent parent for the purposes of paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Act. Regulation 12 provides for the calculation of the disposable income of the absent parent for the purposes of that paragraph.

Regulation 13 prescribes the minimum amount of child support maintenance for the purposes of paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the Act.

Regulations 19 to 27 and Schedule 4 prescribe the circumstances in which cases are to be treated as special cases for the purposes of the Act. These include cases where both parents are absent; where more than one application for child support maintenance is made in relation to the same absent where care arrangements are shared and for child support maintenance not to be payable in certain circumstances.

Regulation 28 makes provision for the amount payable where the absent parent is in receipt of income support or other prescribed benefit.
