%

\renewcommand\parthead{— Explanatory Note}

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

The Regulations contained in this Instrument are made either by virtue of, or~in consequence of, provisions in the Welfare Reform and~Pensions Act 1999 (c.~30) (“the 1999 Act”). This Instrument is made before the expiry of the period of 6 months beginning with the coming into force of those provisions; the regulations in it are therefore exempt from the requirement in section~172(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c.\ 5) to refer proposals to make Regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee and~are made without reference to that Committee.

Part I of these Regulations contains general provisions relating to their citation, commencement and~interpretation (regulations 1 to 3 and~Schedule~1). They also provide for~the Regulations to apply in certain areas of the country only.

Part II relates to the work-focused interview. Regulation~4 specifies those persons claiming social security benefits who are required to take part in a work-focused interview. Regulation~5 specifies a number of exemptions. Regulation~6 specifies circumstances in which a claimant’s continuing entitlement to the full amount of benefit is to be dependent upon his taking part in a work-focused interview.

Regulations 7 and~8 contain provisions as to waiver and~deferment. Regulation~9 specifies when a requirement to take part in 2 or~more work-focused interviews is satisfied by the person taking part in a single interview. Regulation~10 provides for~the claimant to be advised of the time and~place of the interview.

Regulation~11 sets out the requirements for~taking part in a work-focused interview and~regulation~12 details the consequences of a failure to take part in the interview. Regulation~13 specifies circumstances where those consequences do not apply. Regulation~14 specifies the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person had good cause for~his failure to take part in an interview.

Regulation~15 provides a right of appeal against a decision that a person did not take part in a work-focused interview.

Regulation~16 and~Schedules 2 to 6 contain amendments consequential upon these changes and~regulation~17 contains amendments to the Social Security (Claims and~Information) Regulations 1999.

These Regulations do not impose a charge on businesses.
