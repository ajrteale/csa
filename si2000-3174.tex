\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations provide for a temporary compensation scheme made under section 27 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (“the Act”) in certain cases where there has been a delay in the making of a maintenance assessment under the Child Support Act 1991 leading to arrears of child support maintenance.

Regulation 1 contains interpretation provisions.

Regulation 2 sets out the cases additional to those in the Act to which the scheme will apply.

Regulation 3 provides the prescribed date for the purposes of section 27(1)($a$)  of the Act.

Regulation 4 prescribes the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may agree that the absent parent will not be required to pay the whole of the arrears due under a maintenance assessment and the Secretary of State will not seek to recover any of the arrears.

Regulation 5 prescribes the terms of the agreement when the scheme shall apply.

The impact on business of these Regulations was covered in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the 2000 Act in accordance with which, and in consequence of which, these Regulations are made. A copy of that RIA has been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament and can be obtained from the Department of Social Security, Regulatory Impact Unit, Adelphi, 1--11 John Adam Street, London \textsc{\lowercase{WC2N 6HT}}.
