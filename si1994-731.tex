\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Order)}

This Order is made in consequence of the coming into force of the Child Support Act 1991. It amends section 59 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 so as to provide that a Magistrates' Court may order payments under a maintenance order which are to be made by someone who is ordinarily resident in England and Wales to be made in accordance with arrangements made by the Secretary of State under section 30 of the Child Support Act 1991 and regulations made under that section. Consequential amendments are also made to the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates' Courts Act 1978 and the Children Act 1989.

  This Order does not impose any costs on business.
