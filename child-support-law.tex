\renewcommand\parthead{ --- Schedule 1 Part I}

\subsubsection*{\itshape The maintenance requirement}

1.---(1) In this Schedule “the maintenance requirement” means the amount, calculated in accordance with the formula set out in sub-paragraph (2), which is to be taken as the minimum amount necessary for the maintenance of the qualifying child or, where there is more than one qualifying child, all of them.

(2) The formula is—
\[
MR = AG - CB
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $MR$ is the amount of the maintenance requirement;

    $AG$ is the aggregate of the amounts to be taken into account under sub-paragraph (3); and

    $CB$ is the amount payable by way of child benefit (or which would be so payable if the person with care of the qualifying child were an individual) or, where there is more than one qualifying child, the aggregate of the amounts so payable with respect to each of them. 
\end{enumerate}

(3) The amounts to be taken into account for the purpose of calculating $AG$ are—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) such amount or amounts (if any), with respect to each qualifying child, as may be prescribed;

($b$) such amount or amounts (if any), with respect to the person with care of the qualifying child or qualifying children, as may be prescribed; and

($c$) such further amount or amounts (if any) as may be prescribed.
\end{enumerate}

(4) For the purposes of calculating $CB$ it shall be assumed that child benefit is payable with respect to any qualifying child at the basic rate.

(5) In sub-paragraph (4)  “basic rate” has the meaning for the time being prescribed.

\amendment{
Para. 1(3), (5) came into force 27.6.92; para. 1 came fully into force 5.4.93.
}

\subsubsection*{\itshape The general rule}

2.---(1) In order to determine the amount of any maintenance assessment, first calculate—
\[
(A + C) \times P
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $A$ is the absent parent’s assessable income;

    $C$ is the assessable income of the other parent, where that parent is the person with care, and otherwise has such value (if any) as may be prescribed; and

    $P$ is such number greater than zero but less than 1 as may be prescribed. 
\end{enumerate}

(2) Where the result of the calculation made under sub-paragraph (1)  is an amount which is equal to, or less than, the amount of the maintenance requirement for the qualifying child or qualifying children, the amount of maintenance payable by the absent parent for that child or those children shall be an amount equal to—
\[
A \times P
\]
where $A$ and $P$ have the same values as in the calculation made under sub-paragraph~(1).

(3) Where the result of the calculation made under sub-paragraph (1)  is an amount which exceeds the amount of the maintenance requirement for the qualifying child or qualifying children, the amount of maintenance payable by the absent parent for that child or those children shall consist of—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) a basic element calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph~3; and

($b$) an additional element calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.
\end{enumerate}

\amendment{
Para. 2(1) came into force 27.6.92; para. 2 came fully into force 5.4.93.
}

\subsubsection*{\itshape The basic element}

3.---(1) The basic element shall be calculated by applying the formula—
\[
BE = A \times G \times P
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $BE$ is the amount of the basic element;

    $A$ and $P$ have the same values as in the calculation made under paragraph~2(1); and

    $G$ has the value determined under sub-paragraph (2). 
\end{enumerate}

(2) The value of $G$ shall be determined by applying the formula—
\[
G = \frac{MR}{(A + C) \times P}
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $MR$ is the amount of the maintenance requirement for the qualifying child or qualifying children; and

    $A$, $C$ and $P$ have the same values as in the calculation made under paragraph~2(1). 
\end{enumerate}

\amendment{
Para. 3 came into force 5.4.93.
}

\subsubsection*{\itshape The additional element}

4.---(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the additional element shall be calculated by applying the formula—
\[
AE = (1 - G) \times A \times R
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $AE$ is the amount of the additional element;

    $A$ has the same value as in the calculation made under paragraph~2(1);

    $G$ has the value determined under paragraph 3(2); and

    $R$ is such number greater than zero but less than 1 as may be prescribed. 
\end{enumerate}

(2) Where applying the alternative formula set out in sub-paragraph (3)  would result in a lower amount for the additional element, that formula shall be applied in place of the formula set out in sub-paragraph (1).

(3) The alternative formula is—
\[
AE = \frac{Z \times Q \times A}{A + C}
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $A$ and $C$ have the same values as in the calculation made under paragraph~2(1);

    $Z$ is such number as may be prescribed; and

    $Q$ is the aggregate of— 
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) any amount taken into account by virtue of paragraph 1(3)($a$)  in calculating the maintenance requirement; and

($b$) any amount which is both taken into account by virtue of paragraph~1(3)($c$)  in making that calculation and is an amount prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\amendment{
Para. 4(1), (3) came into force 27.6.92; para. 4 came fully into force 5.4.93.
}

\subsubsection*{\itshape Assessable income}

5.---(1) The assessable income of an absent parent shall be calculated by applying the formula—
\[
A = N - E
\]
where—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
    $A$ is the amount of that parent’s assessable income;

    $N$ is the amount of that parent’s net income, calculated or estimated in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this sub-paragraph; and

    $E$ is the amount of that parent’s exempt income, calculated or estimated in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State for those purposes.
