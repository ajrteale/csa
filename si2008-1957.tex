%\subsection*{(This note is not part of these Regulations)}
%
%These Regulations amend the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (S.I.~1999/991) (“the 1999 Regulations”). The 1999 Regulations supplement changes introduced by the Social Security Act 1998 (c.~14) and provide for procedural rules and other requirements of a new unified appeals system introduced by the Act for social security, child support, contracting out of pensions and vaccine damage.
%
%These Regulations amend the provisions setting out the legal qualifications required for a person to become a panel member for the purposes of section 6 of the 1998 Act by substituting a reference to qualification as a solicitor or barrister (or a qualification specified by Order) in place of a reference to a qualification mentioned in section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (c.~41) for appointment as a panel member.
