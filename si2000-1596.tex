(8) An application for an extension of time shall not be granted unless the panel member is satisfied that—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) if the application is granted there are reasonable prospects that the application to set aside will be successful; and

($b$) it is in the interests of justice for the application for an extension of time to be granted.
\end{enumerate}

(9) For the purposes of paragraph (8) it is not in the interests of justice to grant an application for an extension of time unless the panel member is satisfied that—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) the special circumstances specified in paragraph (10) are relevant to that application; or

($b$) some other special circumstances exist which are wholly exceptional and relevant to that application,
\end{enumerate}
and as a result of those special circumstances, it was not practicable for the application to set aside to be made within the time limit specified in paragraph (3)($a$).

(10) For the purposes of paragraph (9)($a$)  the special circumstances are that—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) the applicant or a spouse or dependant of the applicant has died or suffered serious illness;

($b$) the applicant is not resident in the United Kingdom; or

($c$) normal postal services were disrupted.
\end{enumerate}

(11) In determining whether it is in the interests of justice to grant an application for an extension of time, the panel member shall have regard to the principle that the greater the amount of time that has elapsed between the expiry of the time within which the application to set aside is to be made and the making of the application for an extension of time, the more compelling should be the special circumstances on which the application for an extension is based.

(12) An application under this regulation for an extension of time which has been refused may not be renewed.”.

\begin{enumerate}\item[]
(i) the result of which is that his benefit week changes; or

(ii) under regulation 13 of the Claims and Payment Regulations and an award of that benefit on the relevant day for the purposes of that regulation means that his benefit week is expected to change.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

4.  A superseding decision made in consequence of a payment of income being treated as paid on a particular day under regulation 31(1)($b$)  or (2) or 39C(3) of the Income Support Regulations (date on which income is treated as paid) shall take effect from the day on which that payment is treated as paid.

(i) where the relevant change has occurred, from the first day of the benefit week following that in which that superseding decision is made; or

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Jobseeker’s Allowance}

7.  Subject to paragraphs 8 to 11, where a decision in respect of a claim for jobseeker’s allowance is superseded on the ground that there has been or there is expected to be, a relevant change of circumstances, the supersession shall take effect from the first day of the benefit week (as defined in regulation 1(3) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations) in which that relevant change of circumstances occurs or is expected to occur.

\medskip

8.  Where the relevant change of circumstances giving rise to the supersession is that—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) entitlement to jobseeker’s allowance ends, or is expected to end, for a reason other than that the claimant no longer satisfies the provisions of section 3(1)($a$)  of the Jobseekers Act\footnote{\frenchspacing 1995 c. 18.}; or

($b$) a child or young person who is normally in the care of a local authority or who is detained in custody lives, or is expected to live, with the claimant for a part only of the benefit week; or

($d$) the partner of the claimant or a member of his family ceases, or is expected to cease, to be a hospital in-patient for a period of less than a week,
\end{enumerate}
the supersession shall take effect from the date that the relevant change of circumstances occurs or is expected to occur.

\medskip

9.  Where the relevant change of circumstances giving rise to a supersession is any of those specified in paragraph 8, and, in consequence of those circumstances ceasing to apply, a further superseding decision is made, that further superseding decision shall take effect from the date that those circumstances ceased to apply.

\medskip

10.  Where, under the provisions of regulation 96 or 102C(3) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations\footnote{\frenchspacing S.I. 1996/207; the relevant amending instrument is S.I. 1998/1174.}, income is treated as paid on a certain date and that payment gives rise, or is expected to give rise, to a relevant change of circumstance resulting in a supersession, that supersession shall take effect from that date.

\medskip

11.  Where a relevant change of circumstances occurs which results, or is expected to result, in a reduced award of jobseeker’s allowance then, if the Secretary of State is of the opinion that it is impracticable for a supersession to take effect in accordance with the preceding paragraphs of this Schedule, the supersession shall take effect from the first day of the benefit week following that in which the relevant change of circumstances occurs.”.
