6.---(1)  The day appointed for the coming into force of the provisions specified in paragraph (2) for the purposes of cases specified in paragraph (3) is—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) as respects any case specified in paragraph (3)($a$)  where, before 3rd March 2003, relevant maintenance is paid or payable—

(ii) where the maintenance calculation in relation to that case takes effect on a day later than 3rd March 2003, that later day;
\end{enumerate}

($c$) as respects any case which is specified in paragraph (3)($b$)—

(ii) where a day later than 3rd March 2003 is the case conversion date in relation to that case, that later day;
\end{enumerate}

($d$) as respects any case specified in paragraph (3)($c$)  which is referred to—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
(i) in paragraph ($a$)  of article 4, the day on which the claim for the benefit mentioned in that paragraph is made,

(ii) in paragraph ($b$)  of that article, the day on which the Secretary of State is notified that the authorisation mentioned in sub-paragraph (iii)  of that paragraph is withdrawn,

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Order)}

This Order makes further provision as to the coming into force of Part I of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (c.\ 19) (“the Act”).

In particular, this Order amends the provision made in an earlier Order as to the day appointed for the coming into force of section 23 of the Act (which provides for section 10 of the Child Support Act 1995 to cease to have effect) and the associated repeal of that section 10 for the purposes of different categories of cases where child support and other forms of maintenance have been, or become, payable in respect of a child.

This Order does not impose any new costs on business.
