\renewcommand\parthead{--- Explanatory Note}

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations amend the Child Support (Information, Evidence and Disclosure) Regulations 1992, the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992 and the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992, all of which are made under the Child Support Act 1991 (“the Act”).

  Regulation 2 of the Child Support (Information, Evidence and Disclosure) Regulations is amended to impose an obligation on employers to provide information for certain purposes about an alleged absent parent who denies parentage (regulation 2).

  Regulation 3 of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations is amended to provide that where an interim maintenance assessment has been made and at that time there was a court order in force in respect of children covered by that interim maintenance assessment, the effective date of any subsequent maintenance assessment shall be the effective date of that interim maintenance assessment (regulation 3).

 The Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations are amended in the following respects—

 (1) regulation 8 is amended to make provision for the effective date of an interim maintenance assessment reviewed under section 16 or 19(1) of the Act and to clarify the provision for the setting of the effective date of an interim maintenance assessment where a court order is in force in respect of the relevant child (regulation 5);

 (2) regulation 10 is amended to set out the information to be included in the notification which must be given where a Category A interim maintenance assessment is made, or a fresh such assessment issued after a review (regulation 6);

 (3) regulation 30 is amended to provide that where a court order is in force in respect of the relevant children at the time a maintenance assessment is made, or was in force at the time an interim maintenance assessment was made which preceded the making of the maintenance assessment, the effective date of the assessment is set by regulation 3(5) or (7) of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations (regulation 7);

 (4) regulation 31 is amended to make additional provision for the effective date of an assessment, reviewed because the original effective date was incorrect (regulation 8).

  These Regulations do not impose any costs on business.
