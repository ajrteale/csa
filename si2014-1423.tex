14th May 2014

Sir,

I have the honour to refer to the Memorandum of Arrangements relating to the provision 
made for Child Support Maintenance between the Secretary of State for Social Security of 
the one part and the Department of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland of the 
other part which came into effect on 5th April 1993, as amended in accordance with---
\begin{enumerate}\item[] 
($a$) the Exchange of Letters from the Secretary of State for Social Security to the 
Department of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland of 7th November 
1995 and from the Department of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland 
to the Secretary of State for Social Security of 8th November 1995;

($b$) the Exchange of Letters from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions to the Minister for Social Development of 11th March 2002 and from
the Minister for Social Development to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions of 14th March 2002; and

($c$) the Exchange of Letters from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions to the Minister for Social Development of 9th August 2012 and from
the Minister for Social Development to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions of 10th September 2012,
\end{enumerate}
(which Memorandum in its amended form is referred to in this letter as ``the Principal
Memorandum'').

I refer also to recent discussions between the Department for Work and Pensions and the
Department for Social Development concerning the need to amend the Principal
Memorandum so as to make further provision in relation to child support matters.

I now have the honour, with the consent of the Treasury, to propose the following amendments to the Principal Memorandum.

In Article 5---
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) for paragraph (8) substitute---
\begin{quotation}
``(8) An application for a maintenance calculation which is to be determined in
accordance with the new calculation rules shall be dealt with in, and in accordance
with the provision made for, the territory in which the person who makes the
application resides until---
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) where the applicant resides in Great Britain---
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
(i) the application is taken to have been made for the purposes of
regulation 9(2) (applications under section~4 or 7 of the Act) of the
Child Support Maintenance Calculation Regulations 2012\footnote{S.I.~2012/2677.},

(ii) any application fee payable under regulation 3(1) of the Child Support Fees Regulations 2014\footnote{S.I.~2014/612.} has been paid or waived in accordance with those Regulations,

(iii) the Secretary of State has ascertained and verified the address of the
non-resident parent in relation to the application, and

(iv) where the application is one to which paragraph~(8A) or (8B) applies,

resident parent in relation to the application, and

\begin{quotation}

the case of an application made by a qualifying child under section 7(1) of the
Act, or a maintenance calculation or assessment made in response to an

letter and your reply to that effect shall constitute a Memorandum of Arrangements

\part{Explanatory Note}

\renewcommand\parthead{— Explanatory Note}

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations give effect in Great Britain to amendments made to reciprocal arrangements relating to matters for which provision is made by the Child Support Act 1991 and, in Northern Ireland, by the Child Support (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.

These amendments make provision so that, where the 2012 calculation rules apply to a child support case, the case will be dealt with in and under the provision of the territory in which the applicant resides until certain requirements are met. In all cases, the requirements are that: the application is taken to have been made; the address of the non-resident parent in relation to that application has been ascertained and verified; and, where the applicant resides in Great Britain, any application fee must have been paid or waived. An additional requirement must be satisfied in two scenarios. Firstly, where there is an existing case (that is a 1993 or 2003 scheme case) linked to the new application, any liability end date must have passed (that is, the date determined as the date beyond which no further liability accrues in relation to the existing case in accordance with regulations made in the relevant territory). Secondly, where the application is a choice to remain in the statutory scheme, made following the parties in an existing case being required to choose whether or not to remain in the statutory scheme, the liability end date must have passed. Where these requirements are met and the non-resident parent resides in a different jurisdiction from the applicant, the case will be transferred to the territory in which the non-resident parent resides and the provisions applying in that territory will apply.

The amendments are contained in the Exchange of Letters between the Minister of State for the Department for Work and Pensions and the Minister for Social Development set out in the Schedule to the Regulations.

An impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as it has no impact on the private sector or civil society organisations.
