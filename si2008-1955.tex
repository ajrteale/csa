%\subsection*{(This note is not part of these Regulations)}
%
%These Regulations amend the Child Support Commissioners (Procedure) Regulations 1999 (S.I.~1999/1305) (“the 1999 Regulations”). The 1999 Regulations make provision for the procedure to be followed in proceedings before a Child Support Commissioner under the Child Support Act 1991 (c.~48) and include provisions concerning leave to appeal to a Child Support Commissioner from an appeal tribunal constituted under the Social Security Act 1998 (c.~14) (“the 1998 Act”). The chairmen of appeal tribunals for these purposes may be fee-paid or salary paid office-holders appointed to the panel constituted in accordance with section~6 of the 1998 Act.
%
%These Regulations amend the definition of a panel member in the 1999 Regulations by substituting a reference to qualification as a solicitor or barrister (or a qualification specified by Order) in place of a reference to a qualification mentioned in section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (c.~41) for appointment as a panel member.
