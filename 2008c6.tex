2. In Part I (under which the weekly amount of child support maintenance payable is calculated by reference to the non-resident parent's net weekly income), for “net”, in each place where it occurs, substitute “gross”.

\subsection*{Change to basic rate}

3. For paragraph 2 (basic rate) substitute—

9\% where the non-resident parent has one qualifying child;

12\% where the non-resident parent has two qualifying children;

(3) First, calculate the amount which would be payable if the non-resident parent's qualifying children also included every child with respect to whom the non-resident parent is a party to a qualifying maintenance arrangement.

(4) Second, divide the amount so calculated by the number of children taken into account for the purposes of the calculation.

(5) Third, multiply the amount so found by the number of children who, for purposes other than the calculation under sub-\hspace{0pt}paragraph (3), are qualifying children of the non-resident parent.

(6) For the purposes of this paragraph, the non-resident parent is a party to a qualifying maintenance arrangement with respect to a child if the non-resident parent is—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]

(b) a party to an agreement of a prescribed description which provides for the non-resident parent to make payments for the benefit of the child,
\end{enumerate}

\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Shared care}

6. In paragraph 7(2) (circumstances in which decrease for shared care applies in cases where child support maintenance is payable at the basic rate or a reduced rate), for “If the care of a qualifying child is shared” substitute “If the care of a qualifying child is, or is to be, shared”.
