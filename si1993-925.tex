\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations further amend the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 in relation to the way in which payments in place of payments of child support maintenance under section 43 of the Child Support Act are to be apportioned in cases where there is more than one person with care. Provision is also made for the date when a decision given on review of a decision relating to such payments is to have effect.
