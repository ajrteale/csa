\subsection[2. Calculation of amounts]{Calculation of amounts}

2.---(1)  Where any amount is to be considered in connection with any calculation made under these Regulations or under Schedule~1 to the Act, it shall be calculated as a weekly amount and, except where the context otherwise requires, any reference to such an amount shall be construed accordingly.

(2) Subject to paragraph~(3), where any calculation made under these Regulations or under Schedule~1 to the Act results in a fraction of a penny that fraction shall be treated as a penny if it is either one half or exceeds one half, otherwise it shall be disregarded.

(3) Where the calculation of the basic rate of child support maintenance or the reduced rate of child support maintenance results in a fraction of a pound that fraction shall be treated as a pound if it is either one half or exceeds one half, otherwise it shall be disregarded.

(4) In taking account of any amounts or information required for the purposes of making a maintenance calculation, the Secretary of State shall apply the dates or periods specified in these Regulations as applicable to those amounts or information, provided that if he becomes aware of a material change of circumstances occurring after such date or period, but before the effective date, he shall take that change of circumstances into account.

\subsection[6. Apportionment]{Apportionment}

6.  If, in making the apportionment required by regulation~4(3) or paragraph~6 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act, the effect of the application of regulation~2(2) (rounding) would be such that the aggregate amount of child support maintenance payable by a non-resident parent would be different from the aggregate amount payable before any apportionment, the Secretary of State shall adjust that apportionment so as to eliminate that difference; and that adjustment shall be varied from time to time so as to secure that, taking one week with another and so far as is practicable, each person with care receives the amount which she would have received if no adjustment had been made under this paragraph.

\subsection[7. Shared care]{Shared care}

7.---(1)  For the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act a night will count for the purposes of shared care where the non-resident parent—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) has the care of a qualifying child overnight; and

($b$) the qualifying child stays at the same address as the non-resident parent.
\end{enumerate}

(2) For the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act, a non-resident parent has the care of a qualifying child when he is looking after the child.

(3) Subject to paragraph~(4), in determining the number of nights for the purposes of shared care, the Secretary of State shall consider the 12 month period ending with the relevant week and for this purpose “relevant week” has the same meaning as in the definition of day to day care in regulation~1 of these Regulations.

(4) The circumstances in which the Secretary of State may have regard to a number of nights over less than a 12 month period are where there has been no pattern for the frequency with which the non-resident parent looks after the qualifying child for the 12 months preceding the relevant week, or the Secretary of State is aware that a change in that frequency is intended, and in that case he shall have regard to such lesser period as may seem to him to be appropriate, and the Table in paragraph~7(4) and the period in paragraph~8(2) of Schedule~1 to the Act shall have effect subject to the adjustment described in paragraph~(5).

(5) Where paragraph~(4) applies, the Secretary of State shall adjust the number of nights in that lesser period by applying to that number the ratio which the period of 12 months bears to that lesser period.

(6) Where a child is a boarder at a boarding school, or is a patient in a hospital, the person who, but for those circumstances, would otherwise have care of the child overnight shall be treated as providing that care during the periods in question.

\section[Part~III --- Special cases]{Part~III\\*Special cases}

\renewcommand\parthead{--- Part~III}

\subsection[8. Persons treated as non-resident parents]{Persons treated as non-resident parents}

; and

($b$) at least one of those persons is a parent of the child,
\end{enumerate}
that case shall be treated as a special case for the purposes of the Act.

(2) For the purposes of this special case a parent who provides day to day care for a child of his is to be treated as a non-resident parent for the purposes of the Act in the following circumstances—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) a parent who provides such care to a lesser extent than the other parent, person or persons who provide such care for the child in question; or

($b$) where the persons mentioned in paragraph~(1)($a$)  include both parents and the circumstances are such that care is provided to the same extent by both but each provides care to an extent greater than or equal to any other person who provides such care for that child—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
(i) the parent who is not in receipt of child benefit for the child in question; or

(ii) if neither parent is in receipt of child benefit for that child, the parent who, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, will not be the principal provider of day to day care for that child.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

(3) For the purposes of this regulation~and regulation~10 “child benefit” means child benefit payable under Part~IX of the Contributions and Benefits Act.

}

\subsection[9. Care provided in part by a local authority]{Care provided in part by a local authority}

9.---(1)  This regulation~applies where paragraph~(2) applies and the rate of child support maintenance payable is the basic rate, or the reduced rate, or has been calculated following agreement to a variation where the non-resident parent’s liability would otherwise have been a flat rate or the nil rate.

(2) Where the circumstances of a case are that the care of the qualifying child is shared between the person with care and a local authority and—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) the qualifying child is in the care of the local authority for 52 nights or more in the 12 month period ending with the relevant week; or

($b$) where, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, a period other than the 12 month period mentioned in sub-paragraph~($a$)  is more representative of the current arrangements for the care of the qualifying child, the qualifying child is in the care of the local authority during that period for no fewer than the number of nights which bears the same ratio to 52 nights as that period bears to 12 months; or%\looseness=-1

($c$) it is intended that the qualifying child shall be in the care of the local authority for a number of nights in a period from the effective date,
\end{enumerate}
that case shall be treated as a special case for the purposes of the Act.

(3) In a case where this regulation~applies, the amount of child support maintenance which the non-resident parent is liable to pay the person with care of that qualifying child is the amount calculated in accordance with the provisions of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act and decreased in accordance with this regulation.

(4) First, there is to be a decrease according to the number of nights spent or to be spent by the qualifying child in the care of the local authority during the period under consideration.

(5) Where paragraph~(2)($b$)  or ($c$)  applies, the number of nights in the period under consideration shall be adjusted by the ratio which the period of 12 months bears to the period under consideration.

(6) After any adjustment under paragraph~(5), the amount of the decrease for one child is set out in the following Table—

\begin{center}
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\itshape Number of nights in care of local authority	& \itshape Fraction to subtract\\
\hline
52–103	&One-seventh\\
104–155	&Two-sevenths\\
156–207	&Three-sevenths\\
208–259	&Four-sevenths\\
260–262	&Five-sevenths\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

(7) If the non-resident parent and the person with care have more than one qualifying child, the applicable decrease is the sum of the appropriate fractions in the Table divided by the number of such qualifying children.

(8) In a case where the amount of child support maintenance which the non-resident parent is liable to pay in relation to the same person with care is to be decreased in accordance with the provisions of both this regulation~and of paragraph~7 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act, read with regulation~7 of these Regulations, the applicable decrease is the sum of the appropriate fractions derived under those provisions.

\begin{sloppypar}
(9) If the application of this regulation~would decrease the weekly amount of child support maintenance (or the aggregate of all such amounts) payable by the non-resident parent to less than the rate stated in or prescribed for the purposes of paragraph~4(1) of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act, he is instead liable to pay child support maintenance at a rate equivalent to that rate, apportioned (if appropriate) in accordance with paragraph~6 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act and regulation~6.
\end{sloppypar}

(10) Where a qualifying child is a boarder at a boarding school or is an in-patient at a hospital, the qualifying child shall be treated as being in the care of the local authority for any night that the local authority would otherwise have been providing such care.

(11) A child is in the care of a local authority for any night in which he is being looked after by the local authority within the meaning of section~22 of the Children Act 1989\footnote{1989 c.\ 41.} or section~17(6) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995\footnote{1995 c.\ 36.}.

\subsection[10. Care provided for relevant other child by a local authority]{Care provided for relevant other child by a local authority}

10.  Where a child other than a qualifying child is cared for in part or in full by a local authority and the non-resident parent or his partner receives child benefit for that child, the child is a relevant other child for the purposes of Schedule~1 to the Act.

\subsection[11. Non-resident parent liable to pay maintenance under a maintenance order]{\sloppy\hbadness=1522 Non-resident parent liable to pay maintenance under a maintenance order}

\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) calculating the amount of maintenance payable as if the number of qualifying children of that parent included any children with respect to whom he is liable to make payments under the order referred to in paragraph~(1)($b$); and

($b$) apportioning the amount so calculated between the qualifying children and the children with respect to whom he is liable to make payments under the order referred to in paragraph~(1)($b$),
\end{enumerate}
and the amount payable shall be the amount apportioned to the qualifying children, and the amount payable to each person with care shall be that amount subject to the application of apportionment under paragraph~6 of Schedule~1 to the Act and the shared care provisions in paragraph~7 of Part~I of that Schedule.

(4) In a case where this regulation~applies paragraph~7 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act (shared care) and regulation~10 (care provided in part by local authority) shall not apply in relation to a child in respect of whom the non-resident parent is liable to make payments under a maintenance order as provided in paragraph~(1)($b$).

\renewcommand\parthead{--- Explanatory Note}

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations provide for various matters relating to the calculation of child support maintenance under the Child Support Act 1991 (“the Act”) and also make provision for special cases under the Act, consequent upon the introduction of changes to the child support system made by the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (c.\ 48). Subject to savings for transitional purposes, these Regulations revoke the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (S.I.~1992/1815). Apart from paragraphs (1) and (2) of regulation~4, which come into force on 31st January 2001, these Regulations come into force at different times for different cases according to the dates on which provisions of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 which are relevant to these Regulations are commenced for different types of cases.

Regulation 1 contains provisions relating to citation, commencement and interpretation.

Regulation 2 contains general provisions regarding the calculation of child support maintenance under the Act. The Schedule~to these Regulations prescribes the amounts to be taken into account to calculate net weekly income for the purposes of Schedule~1 to the Act.

Regulation 3 prescribes the method of calculating the reduced rate of child support maintenance and regulation~4 prescribes the benefits, pensions and allowances for the purposes of paragraph~4(1) of Schedule~1 to the Act (flat rate cases).

Regulation 5 prescribes the circumstances for which the rate payable is nil.

Regulation 6 provides a general rule for adjusting the child support maintenance payable following apportionment and regulation~7 prescribes the circumstances in which a night will count for the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8 of Part~I of Schedule~1 to the Act (shared care).

Regulations 8 to 14 prescribe the circumstances in which cases are to be treated as special cases for the purposes of the Act. These include cases where persons are treated as non-resident parents; where care of a qualifying child or a relevant other child is provided in part by a local authority; where the non-resident parent is liable to pay maintenance under a maintenance order; where a child is a boarder or an in-patient in hospital; where a child is allowed to live with his parent under section~23(5) of the Children Act 1989 and where a person with part-time care of the child is not a non-resident parent.

Regulation 15 revokes the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992, with savings for transitional purposes.

The impact on business of these Regulations was covered in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the Child Support, Pensions, and Social Security Act 2000, in accordance with which, and in consequence of which, these Regulations are made. A copy of that RIA has been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament and can be obtained from the Department of Social Security, Regulatory Impact Unit, Adelphi, 1--11 John Adam Street, London \textsc{\lowercase{WC2N 6HT}}.
