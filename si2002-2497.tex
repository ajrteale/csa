\part{Explanatory Note}

\renewcommand\parthead{— Explanatory Note}

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations amend the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 (S.I.\ 1976/409) and other Regulations as a consequence of changes made to section 70 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 by the Regulatory Reform (Carer’s Allowance) Order 2002 (S.I.\ 2002/1457).

Regulation 2 revokes regulations 10 and 11 of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976. These regulations are revoked as the powers under which they are made, namely section 70(5) and (6) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, are repealed by article 3(2) of the Regulatory Reform (Carer’s Allowance) Order 2002.

Regulation 3 brings into force Schedule 2 to these Regulations which makes changes to secondary legislation, as a consequence of the change of the name of the allowance from invalid care allowance to carer’s allowance.

These Regulations do not impose any charge on business.
