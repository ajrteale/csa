\subsection[12. Failure to take part in an interview]{Failure to take part in an interview}

12.---(1)  Where a relevant decision has been made in accordance with regulation~11(4), a relevant person or, where the relevant person is a partner, the benefit recipient shall, subject to paragraph~(13), suffer the consequences set out below.

(2) Those consequences are—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) where the requirement to take part in an interview arose under regulation~3 in connection with a claim for income support or incapacity benefit, that the relevant person to whom the claim relates is, subject to sub-paragraph~($b$), to be regarded as not having made that claim for that benefit;

($b$) where the requirement to take part in an interview which arose under regulation~3 in connection with a claim for income support or incapacity benefit was deferred and~that benefit became payable by virtue of regulation~7(3), that the relevant person’s entitlement to that benefit shall terminate from the first day of the next benefit week following the date on which the relevant decision was made;

($c$) where the relevant person or, where the relevant person is a partner, the benefit recipient has an award of a specified benefit and~the requirement to take part in an interview arose under regulation~4, the specified benefit payable in respect of which the requirement to take part in an interview arose shall be reduced.
\end{enumerate}

(3) The reduction made to benefit in accordance with paragraph~(2)($c$)  shall (subject to paragraphs~(4) and~(5)) be by a sum equal to 20 per cent.\ of the amount applicable on the date the reduction commences in respect of a single claimant for income support aged not less than 25 and~shall take effect either as from the first day of the next benefit week following the day on which the relevant decision was made, or, if the relevant person is a partner and~if that date arises five days or less after the day on which the relevant decision was made, as from the first day of the second benefit week following the date of the relevant decision.

(4) Benefit reduced in accordance with paragraph~(2)($c$)  shall not be reduced below ten pence per week.

($b$) income support;

($c$) incapacity benefit;

($d$) severe disablement allowance.
\end{enumerate}

(7) For the purpose of determining whether a specified benefit is the same as, or greater than, the amount of the reduction for the purposes of paragraph~(6), ten pence shall be added to the amount of the reduction.

(8) In a case where the whole of the reduction cannot be applied against any one specified benefit because the amount of no one benefit is the same as, or greater than, the amount of the reduction, the reduction shall be applied against the first benefit in payment in the list of priorities at paragraph~(5) and~so on against each benefit in turn until the whole of the reduction is exhausted or, if this is not possible, the whole of the specified benefits are exhausted, subject in each case to ten pence remaining in payment.

(9) Where the rate of any specified benefit payable to a relevant person, or, where a relevant person is a partner, to a benefit recipient changes, the rules set out above for a reduction in the benefit payable shall be applied to the new rates, and~any adjustments to the benefits against which the reductions are made shall take effect from the beginning of the first benefit week to commence for that relevant person or benefit recipient following the change.

(10) For the avoidance of doubt, paragraph~(2)($c$)  shall apply each time a relevant decision is made in accordance with regulation~11(4) arising from a requirement to take part in an interview under regulation~4 in respect of a relevant person.

(11) For the avoidance of doubt, a relevant person who is regarded as not having made a claim for income support or incapacity benefit because he failed to take part in an interview as a result of a requirement arising under regulation~3 shall be required to make a new claim in order to establish entitlement to that benefit.

(12) For the purposes of determining the amount of any benefit payable, a relevant person, or where a relevant person is a partner, a benefit recipient shall be treated as receiving the amount of any specified benefit which would have been payable but for a reduction made in accordance with this regulation.

(13) Benefit shall not be reduced in accordance with this regulation~where a relevant person or, where the relevant person is a partner, the relevant person or the benefit recipient, brings new facts to the notice of the Secretary of State within one month of the date on which the decision that the relevant person failed without good cause to take part in an interview was notified to him and—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) those facts could not reasonably have been brought to the Secretary of State’s notice within five working days of the day on which the interview was to take place; and

($b$) those facts show that the relevant person had good cause for his failure to take part in the interview.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[13. Circumstances where regulation~12 ceases to apply]{Circumstances where regulation~12 ceases to apply}

13.  Where a reduction of benefit has been made under regulation~12 the whole of the reduction relating to any requirements to attend interviews in respect of a relevant person shall not apply—
\begin{enumerate}\item[]
($a$) where the relevant person subsequently takes part in an interview, as from the first day of the benefit week in which a requirement to take part in an interview was met; or

($b$) as from the date when a relevant person who failed to take part in an interview is no longer a relevant person to whom regulations 3 to 15 apply by virtue of regulation~2(3).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[14. Good cause]{Good cause}

14.  Matters to be taken into account in determining whether the relevant person or, where the relevant person is a partner, the relevant person or the benefit recipient has shown good cause for the relevant person’s failure to take part in an interview include—

\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

These Regulations impose requirements to take part in work-focused interviews (“interviews”) on certain persons who reside in specified areas. The requirements apply to those who make a claim for income support or incapacity benefit or, as at the date that these Regulations come into force, are already entitled to income support except where paragraph~7 (persons incapable of work) of Schedule~1B to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I.~1987/1967) applies. They also apply to the partners of certain recipients of income support, incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance or income-based jobseeker’s allowance (other than a joint-claim jobseeker’s allowance) where the recipient is entitled to the benefit at a higher rate in respect of the partner.

These Regulations also make provision for claimants of a jobseeker’s allowance to participate in an employment zone programme established by the Secretary of State under section 60 of the Welfare Reform and~Pensions Act 1999 (c.~30) to assist them to obtain sustainable employment where those jobseekers reside in areas designated as “employment zones”.

Regulation 1 provides for citation and~commencement, and~regulation~2 provides for interpretation and~application. In particular it provides for these Regulations to apply only to certain persons who reside in areas of the country which are identified in the Schedule.

Regulation 3 specifies those persons who are required to take part in an interview as a condition of a claim for income support or incapacity benefit.

Regulation 4 prescribes that certain persons are required to take part in interviews as a condition of their or, where they are a partner, of the benefit recipient continuing to be paid the full amount of any of the specified benefits to which they are entitled. It also specifies when requirements to take part in interviews will arise.

Regulation 5 prescribes the time when an interview is to take place.

Regulation 6 provides that a requirement to take part in an interview can be waived where it would not be of assistance to the person, or it would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the case, and~regulation~7 provides that an interview can be deferred.

Regulation 8 prescribes circumstances when a person is exempted from a requirement to take part in an interview. Regulation 9 prescribes that where a person is in receipt of two or more specified benefits concurrently requirements to take part in interviews will not arise in relation to each benefit separately. It also specifies when the next requirement will arise where a person in receipt of at least one specified benefit makes a claim for either income support or incapacity benefit.

Regulation 10 provides for a person to be advised of the date, place and~time of the interview and~provides that an interview can take place in the person’s home if it is considered that it would be unreasonable to require the person to attend elsewhere.

Regulation 11 prescribes the circumstances where a person is to be regarded as having taken part in an interview. Regulation 12 sets out the consequences of a failure to take part in an interview, including how benefit can be reduced for such a failure. Regulation 13 specifies the circumstances where those consequences cease to apply, and~regulation~14 specifies examples of matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person had good cause for his failure to take part in an interview.

Regulation 15 provides that a decision that a person has failed to take part in an interview without good cause can be appealed to an appeal tribunal under section 12 of the Social Security Act 1998 (c.~14).

Regulation 16 designates certain areas as employment zones by reference to the postcodes set out in Part~2 of the Schedule.

In conjunction with the provision in regulation~2(4), regulation~17 specifies those jobseekers who may be directed to participate in an employment zone programme and~regulation~18 specifies those jobseekers who may request early entry and~then be directed to participate in an employment zone programme.

Regulation 19 sets out the two stages of the employment zone programme.

Regulation 20 makes provision for certain requirements of the Jobseekers Act 1995 (c.~18) to be suspended in the case of a jobseeker who is participating in an employment zone programme.

Regulation 21 provides for the employment zone provisions in these Regulations to cease to apply to a jobseeker who informs the Secretary of State that he is no longer ordinarily resident within one of the areas set out in Part~2 of the Schedule, unless he asks to complete an employment zone programme which he has already begun. The regulation~also provides for any sanction incurred by that jobseeker under section 19 or 20A of the Jobseekers Act 1995 in relation to his participation (including a failure to participate) in an employment zone programme to end and~for no further such sanctions to be imposed on a jobseeker who asks to continue the employment zone programme under this provision.

Regulation 22 makes a consequential amendment to the Social Security (Claims and~Payments) Regulations 1987 (S.I.~1987/1968) which relates to claims made by persons subject to work-focused interviews.

Regulation 23 amends the definition of “employment zone programme” in regulation~75(1)($a$)(iii)  of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I.~1996/207) which has the effect of enabling sanction provisions under the Jobseekers Act 1995 to apply to defaults by jobseekers in connection with an employment zone programme operated under these Regulations.

Regulation 24 makes consequential amendments to provisions in the Social Security and~Child Support (Decisions and~Appeals) Regulations 1999 (S.I.~1999/991) which relate to work-focused interviews.
