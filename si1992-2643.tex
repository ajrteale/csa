\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

 Section 30(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 enables the Secretary of State to arrange for the collection of prescribed kinds of periodical payments where they are payable to or for the benefit of someone who falls within a prescribed category and he is also arranging for the collection of child support maintenance.

  These Regulations prescribe the kinds of payments which may be collected and the categories of persons to whom they are payable (regulation 2). Regulations 3 and 4 apply in relation to, respectively, England and Wales and Scotland. They apply various provisions of the Act relating to the collection and enforcement of child support maintenance to the periodical payments that may be collected under section 30(1), and also, in relation to Scotland only, enable the Secretary of State to bring any proceedings or take any other steps (other than diligence against earnings) which the person entitled to the payments could have brought or taken.
