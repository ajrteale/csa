\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Regulations)}

This Order brings into force certain paragraphs in Schedule 5 to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 (c.~6) for the purpose of making regulations. It also brings into force section 19 of that Act, which introduces Schedule 5, so far as it relates to those paragraphs. Schedule 5 enables the Secretary of State to require the parties in existing cases (that is, cases administered under the 1993 or 2003 schemes of child support maintenance) to choose whether or not to remain in the statutory scheme under the 2012 rules for calculating child support maintenance. The paragraphs in Schedule 5 that are commenced in this Order enable the Secretary of State to make provision in regulations in relation to requiring the parties to make that choice.
