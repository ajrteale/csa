%    “decision” means a decision of the Secretary of State—
%\begin{enumerate}\item[]

%($a$) that the person making the application for an extension of time or any person acting for him was unaware of or misunderstood the law applicable to his case (including ignorance or misunderstanding of the time limits imposed by these Regulations); or
