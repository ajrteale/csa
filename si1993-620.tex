\subsection*{(This note is not part of the Order)}

This Order preserves the jurisdiction of courts to make a maintenance order in respect of a child in certain circumstances notwithstanding that a child support officer would have jurisdiction to make a maintenance assessment under the Child Support Act 1991 in respect of that child against the person to be liable under the maintenance order. The general effect of section 8 is to prevent the court from exercising any such jurisdiction where such an assessment could be obtained. This Order makes an exception where the order is simply to give effect to substantive provisions which have previously been agreed in writing.
