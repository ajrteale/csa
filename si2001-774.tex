This Order brings into force on 1st April 2001 sections 82 and 83 of, and Schedule 8 and Part IX of Schedule 9 to, the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000. Section 82 amends the provisions of Part III of the Family Law Reform Act 1969 (1969 c.\ 46) on tests for determining parentage. Section 83 inserts a new section 55A in the Family Law Act 1986 (1986 c.\ 55) on applications for declarations of parentage, replacing applications under section 56(1)($a$) of that Act and under section 27 of the Child Support Act 1991 (1991 c.\ 48). Schedule 8 and Part IX of Schedule 9 contain consequential amendments and repeals.
